# UCMS API Contract

**Base URL:** `/api`
**Auth:** Bearer JWT (all routes except `/auth/*`)

**Account gating:** Student accounts are **LIMITED** until they add + verify a real email.
- LIMITED students can login and view data.
- LIMITED students cannot create tickets (and therefore cannot upload attachments).

## Auth

| Method | Endpoint | Role | Description |
|--------|----------|------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/auth/login` | Public | Login with student ID + password |
| POST | `/api/auth/register` | Public | Register (enrolled students only) |
| POST | `/api/auth/forgot-password` | Public | Request password reset |

> **Note:** Password reset is handled entirely by the Android app via Supabase SDK. The backend does not expose a reset-password endpoint.

Notes:
- Registration uses `student_id` as the primary identifier. Format: `YYYY-NNNN-C` (year + 4-digit student number + campus initial, e.g. `20230733-N`). Supabase Auth is used behind the scenes.
- Password reset requires a verified email. If the student has no verified email, return `400` with instructions to add/verify an email.

|--------|----------|------|-------------|

| PUT | `/api/users/me` | Student / Admin | Update name, course, year level |
| PUT | `/api/users/me/email` | Student / Admin | Add/update email; triggers verification; unlocks ticket creation when verified |

## Tickets

| Method | Endpoint | Role | Description |
|--------|----------|------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/tickets` | Student | Create new concern ticket (requires verified email) |
| GET | `/api/tickets` | Student / Admin | Student: own tickets. Admin: all tickets (filter: status, category) |
| GET | `/api/tickets/{id}` | Student / Admin | Get ticket detail |
| PATCH | `/api/tickets/{id}/status` | Admin | Update status (PENDING → IN_PROGRESS → RESOLVED → CLOSED) |

Notes:
- If a student account is LIMITED (email not verified), `POST /api/tickets` must return `403 Forbidden`.

---

## Attachments

| Method | Endpoint | Role | Description |
|--------|----------|------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/tickets/{id}/attachments` | Student | Upload photo/file → Supabase Storage; saves `storage_path` in DB |
| GET | `/api/tickets/{id}/attachments` | Student / Admin | List attachments for a ticket (includes signed URLs) |

Notes:
- Storage bucket is private; URLs returned by the API are signed and expire.
- `original_filename`, `mime_type`, and `size_bytes` are derived by the backend from the uploaded file — the client does not send these fields.

- A category cannot be deleted if any ticket references it — return `409 Conflict`.
